                                    proven after a session of relentless efforts, perseverance and determination never to give up. The Consul General who had been briefed on this development earlier also commended every member of the Association for the unity and empathy
                                    shown in the course of the struggle. He added that our Motherland Nigeria is blessed with great minds who rise up to defend any fallen member and ensure that an injury to one is an injury to all, "Definitely the future of Nigeria is secured" He added.

                                    The National President who recognized both the unquantifiable efforts of NiSIG e.V members, chapter/zonal
                                    coordinators,sister Associations and the help of the Nigerian Embassy in Berlin in making the long journey easier was motivated by the gestures of the Consul General who resumed office three months ago.
                                    
                                    The National President also asked for action to be taken to ease the affairs of members of the association to ensure
                                    that every Nigerian in Germany can boast of the backing of the Nigerian Government in trying times. The Consular General in response to this promised to prioritize the defense of every member of the association and the Nigerian society at large (as long as they remain good Ambassadors of our beloved nation and are not guilty of any allegation) To prove his readiness to fulfill his made promise, he created an office called “student help desk” which will be made active soonest. A staff member will be in charge of this office and the only responsibility will be to attend to the
                                    difficulties of students and combat such problems with immediate effect. The proof to verify the studentship of these students will be discussed with the Embassies(both in Berlin and Frankfurt) soonest. The membership certificate of our members alongside with the enrollment certificate at the respective institutions will serve as valid documents to verify the studentship status/ association membership and the required assistance will be provided without hesitation. We will update our members on the development in this regard from time to time.
                                    
                                    In conclusion, the National President brought to the notice of the consulate General;the creation of a legal arm of the association known as NiSIG legal Practitioners’ initiative (NLPI) whose duty is to guide all members of the association on the laws of the land and to offer legal assistance to the members free of charge. He explained that the group of legal practitioners have helped hundreds of scholars over the last 12 months of existence and were actively involved in Miss Jennifer’s case alongside the private lawyer employed by the association.

                                    The National President extensively discussed the difficulties experienced by our scholars in obtaining their passports. He explained that this hardship affects the scholars’ frame of mind and leaves them unsettled in the midst of their academic and sustenance strives. He emphasized that the workload on the Embassy in Berlin in issuing new passports seems
                                    too heavy and most of our scholars have to travel to Austria, Belgium and other European countries to get their Passport issuance at the respective Nigerian Embassies. The need to also get a renewed residence permit which cannot be achieved with an expired passport affects the grades of our scholars who have to abandon their practicals and studies to travel
                                    for days for passport collection.# The Consul General who understood the situation beforehand appreciated the understanding of the National Executives on this issue and encouraged the National Executives to take up this issue with the National President. the subject matter. In providing a lasting solution to this , he had ordered a printer and sent delegates to Nigeria to perfect this move and put in place the capturing device in the Nigerian Embassy in Frankfurt (as this case had been
                                    communicated to him before our visit). With this, passport issuance will now be done in Frankfurt soonest and modalities in this regard will be communicated to us soon. He also reaffirmed his stand that the representative of the Embassy
                                    handling the ‘student affairs desk’ will be involved in dealing with all issues relating to students and also implored all our members to engage in mutual respect which is the secret of peaceful coexistence and effective responsibility discharge. With this , the issue of passport, paper scarcity and no passport issuance appointment will stop as both embassies will share this responsibility , going forward.

                                will be prioritized as expected. He equally made it known that the merits of acceptance for such internship positions
                                will not be compromised and the team will not be biased in the selection process. He equally discussed the need for
                                career development strategies to be implemented by the Embassy and agreed to channel his efforts in achieving this to
                                the interest of our Association members. With this, integration, career fulfillment, financial stability and other life pleasantries are guaranteed. He also promised that letters of recommendation for job applications will be written by the Embassy for our scholars

                                7.​NIN Registeration
                                
                                The team that visited the Ambassador also made some clarifications about NIN,the significance and the possibility of
                                having it done at the Nigerian Embassy in Germany,Frankfurt for Nigerians living in cities close to this area.
                                
                                
                                
                                The Consul General in person of His Excellency Ambassador Wahab Adekola Akande emphasized on the need for all Nigerians
                                to have this registration done as soon as possible. He also agreed to the fact that traveling to Berlin for those living
                                close to Frankfurt will be too stressful. He then talked on the certainty of having the NIN registration done in
                                Frankfurt to ease the affairs of our scholars.
                                </p>

                                After the fruitful and productive meeting,the Embassy hosted the visiting members of NiSIG e.V in a relaxed mood and
                                “item 7” was observed.
                                
                                The Ambassador in a final note sent his warm regards to all the members of the Association and urged the next
                                administration to give their best in maintaining the standard of the association and preserve the virtues of this
                                current administration. He implored all scholars to strive for excellence in academics and all areas of life. He spoke
                                on the need for all scholars to be good Ambassadors of Nigeria and lift our nation high in Germany and beyond.
                                
                                
                                
                                NB: The National Executives of NiSIG e.V are still in touch with the Nigerian Embassy in Germany(Berlin ) and both
                                Embassies will continually join hands in helping the association when humbly called upon by the National Secretariat of
                                the association.
                                
                                
                                
                                We implore our members to keep us informed on any unpalatable happenings linked with their welfarism that require the
                                urgent intervention of the higher authorities. As usual, we will discharge our duties as expected and such situations
                                will be well handled.
